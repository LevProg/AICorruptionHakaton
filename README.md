## This repository is loaded with a notebook with model training, and application
### This is a project from the Hack AI hackathon

### The application contains functions for downloading the file and its corrected version (with underlined "dangerous paragraphs"). There is also an implementation of viewing the corrected file directly in the application in the form of a pdf viewer.
